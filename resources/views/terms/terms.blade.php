		</li>

		<li>
			<p><b>AUTHORIZATION TO TRADE</b>.good-enough LTD is hereby authorized to purchase and sell the abovementioned types of securities for Client’s account(s) in accordance with Client’s oral, written or electronic instructions.

		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>GOVERNMENTAL, COUNTER PARTY INSTITUTION AND INTER-BANK SYSTEM RULES</b>.All transactions under this Agreement shall be subject to the constitution, by-laws, rules, regulations, customs, usage, rules and interpretations of the counter-party institution or other inter-bank market (and its clearing organization, if any) where executed and to all applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. If any statute shall hereafter be enacted or any rule or regulation shall hereafter be adopted by any governmental authority, which shall be binding upon good-enough LTD, this Agreement shall be deemed modified or superseded, as the case may be, by the applicable provisions of such statute, rule or regulation, and all other provisions of this Agreement and provisions so modified shall in all respects continue in full force and effect. Client acknowledges that all transactions under this Agreement are subject to the aforementioned regulatory requirements.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>MARGIN AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS</b>.Client shall deposit with good-enough LTD collateral or margin in such amounts that good-enough LTD, in its sole discretion, may require. Margin requirements will vary dependent on the electronic trading system and products traded. good-enough LTD may change margin requirements at any time. Client agrees to deposit by immediate wire transfer such additional margin when and as required by good-enough LTD and will promptly meet all margin calls by such methods as good-enough LTD in its sole discretion designates. good-enough LTD may at any time proceed to liquidate Client’s account in accordance with paragraph 10 below, and any failure by good-enough LTD to enforce its rights hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by good-enough LTD to enforce its rights thereafter. No previous collateral or margin requirement by good-enough LTD shall preclude good-enough LTD from increasing that requirement without prior notice. Margin calls are conclusive and binding unless objected to immediately in writing. Client understands that a margin call may occur even in instances where account positions are hedged, given spreads may widen as set forth in paragraph 7 herein, causing remaining margin to diminish. Should remaining margin be insufficient to maintain open positions, the account may sustain a margin call, closing out any open positions in the account.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>POSITION LIMITATION AND EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS.</b>good-enough LTD retains the right to limit the amount and/or total number of open positions that Client may acquire or maintain at good-enough LTD. good-enough LTD reserves the right to refuse to accept any order. good-enough LTD shall not be responsible for any loss or damage caused, directly or indirectly, by any events, actions or omissions beyond the control of good-enough LTD including, withzout limitation, loss or damage resulting, directly or indirectly, from government restrictions, war, strikes, labor disruptions and terroristPage 2 of 7acts. good-enough LTD shall not be liable for damages, including lost profits or trading losses caused by delays or inaccuracies in pricing or the transmission of orders or information due to a breakdown in or failure of any transmission or communication facilities, unauthorized access, theft or systems failures. Client understands good-enough LTD is authorized to reclaim any trading profits Client obtains through the trading of delayed or inaccurate pricing.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>PRICING, CONDITIONAL ORDERS AND GAPPING MARKETS.</b>Client acknowledges and understands that good-enough LTD does not guarantee the execution of orders at specific prices, including conditional orders such as stops and/or limits, specifically at times of increased volatility or volume, including market news announcements, due to gapping markets, grayed out pricing, and market liquidity. Client understands that orders received during instances of increased market volatility will be filled at the next best price available or the fair market value. Client acknowledges that during instances of gapping markets, conditional orders, specifically stop losses, will be filled at the next available price following a gapping market. Pricing can gap past the price set forth in conditional orders, resulting in clients losing more funds than initially intended. Client acknowledges that due to such risks, good-enough LTD encourages clients to utilize market orders rather than conditional orders, as market orders are provided with a requote and allow Clients to accept or reject the new price. Client agrees that good-enough LTD is not responsible for any loses, including margin calls, which occur as a result of conditional orders being filled during a gapping market or orders being filled at certain prices as a result of grayed out pricing and/or limitations in market liquidity.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>WIDENED SPREADS.</b>Client understands and acknowledges that there may be instances where spreads widen beyond the typical spreads offered. During volatile markets, such as news announcements, spreads may widen substantially in order to compensate for increased market volatility. Client is advised to utilize extreme caution when trading during increased volatility in the markets, including major news events, as widened spreads can adversely affect all positions in an account including hedged positions.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>SETTLEMENT DATE, ROLLOVERS AND INTEREST.</b>good-enough LTD is authorized, in its absolute discretion, to rollover or offset all or any portion of positions maintained in CFDs on currencies within Client’s Account(s), maintained on any electronic trading platform at Client’s risk.

All CFDs on Futures are not rolled over at contract expiration. good-enough LTD shall close all positions at expiration of Futures contracts and client may, at his/her sole discretion, elect to purchase a new contract. At its discretion, good-enough LTD may elect to offer Client an interest free account whereby positions carried forward will not be credited or debited interest charges. Client agrees and acknowledges that if such an account is offered by good-enough LTD to Client, good-enough LTD has the authority to, at its own discretion and at anytime and for any reason, begin crediting and/or debiting interest charges to said account without prior notice to Client.</p>

Should Client take delivery of Page 3 of 7 currencies through settlement of trades, good-enough LTD is obliged to make full payment for the delivery on 24 hour notice. If the balance in the Client’s account is not adequate to pay for the delivery, the depository receipts held in the name of Client or good-enough LTD, as Client’s agent or nominee, become property carried on margin in the Client’s account, since they are not fully paid for by Client. This authorization shall apply to all accounts carried by good-enough LTD for Client and shall remain in full force until all accounts are fully paid for by Client or notice of revocation is sent by good-enough LTD.</p>

In liquidation of Client’s long or short positions, good-enough LTD may, in its sole discretion, offset in the same settlement or it may initiate new long or short positions in order to establish a spread or straddle which in the sole discretion of good-enough LTD may be advisable to protect or reduce existing positions in a Client’s account. Any sales or purchases hereunder may be made at good-enough LTD’s discretion with any inter-bank or other market where such business is then usually transacted or at a public auction or private sale, and good-enough LTD may purchase the whole or any part thereof free from any right of redemption. Client shall at all times be liable for the payment of any deficit balance in Client’s account(s) upon demand by good-enough LTD and in all cases, Client shall be liable for any deficiency remaining in Client’s account(s) in the event of the liquidation thereof in whole or in part by good-enough LTD or by Client. In the event the proceeds realized pursuant to this authorization are insufficient for the payment of all obligations and liabilities of Client owed to good-enough LTD, Client shall promptly pay upon demand, the deficit together with interest thereon at a rate equal to three points above the then prevailing prime rate at good-enough LTD’s principal bank or the maximum interest rate allowed by law, whichever is lower.

Failure to object shall be deemed acceptance and ratification of all actions taken by good-enough LTD or good-enough LTD’s agents. Client’s failure to receive a transaction confirmation shall not relieve Client of the duty to inquire of good-enough LTD and to object as set out herein.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>COMMISSIONS AND FEES.</b>Client agrees to pay all charges relating to the CFD transactions conducted by or through good-enough LTD, including without limitation commissions, markups, markdowns, transaction fees, transfer and cancellation charges, and inactive account fees. good-enough LTD may adjust its charges without notice.

		<li>
			<p><b>good-enough LTD RESPONSIBILITIES.</b>good-enough LTD will not be responsible for delays in the transmission of orders due to a breakdown or failure of transmission or communication facilities, electrical power outage or for any other cause beyond good-enough LTD’s control or anticipation. good-enough LTD is not responsible for losses or other adverse affects realized by Client accounts as a result of gapping markets, repricing or instances of increased volatility in the markets. good-enough LTD shall only be liable for its actions directly attributable to gross negligence, willful default or fraud on the part of good-enough LTD. good-enough LTD shall not be liable for losses arising from the default of any agent or any other party used by good-enough LTD under this Agreement. Since over-the-counter Contracts are not traded on an exchange, the prices at which good-enough LTD is willing to deal or the quotes published by good-enough LTD may differ from prices confirmed or quoted by other CFD market makers or dealers.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>IDENTITY VERIFICATION.</b>Client acknowledges and agrees that he/she is required to submit copies of unexpired government issued identification and address verification documentation to good-enough LTD with a signed copy of this Agreement. Client further agrees that good-enough LTD has the authority to delay, cancel or otherwise postpone trading or the depositing/withdrawing of funds, regardless of amount, until Client has provided copies of unexpired government issued identification and/or address verification documentation as required. After receipt of such documentation, good-enough LTD reserves the right to request additional documentation in order for good-enough LTD to adequately verify the Client(s) identity. Client understands that failure to provide such documentation shall authorize and obligate good-enough LTD to report such to applicable government agencies.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>CURRENCY FLUCTUATION RISK.</b>If Client directs good-enough LTD to enter into any CFD transaction: <b>(a)</b> any profit or loss arising as a result of a fluctuation in the exchange rate affecting such currency will be entirely for the risk and account of Client; <b>(b)</b> all deposits for margin purposes if made in currency other than U.S. Dollars may be converted to U.S. Dollars, in such amounts as good-enough LTD may in its sole discretion require; and <b>(c)</b> good-enough LTD is authorized to convert funds in Client’s account for margin into and from such foreign currency at a rate of exchange determined by good-enough LTD in its sole discretion on the basis of the then prevailing money market rates.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>RISK ACKNOWLEDGMENT.</b>Client acknowledges that investments in leveraged and non-leveraged transactions are speculative, involve a high degree of risk, and are appropriate only for persons who can assume risk of loss in excess of their margin deposit to carry CFD positions and may result in significant losses that substantially exceed Client’s investment and margin deposit. Client represents and warrants to good-enough LTD that Client is willing and able, financially and otherwise, to assume the risk of trading in CFD transactions, and in consideration of good-enough LTD’s carrying his/her account(s), Client agrees not to hold good-enough LTD responsible for losses incurred through trading. Client recognizes that guarantees of profit or freedom from loss are impossible in trading Contracts. Client acknowledges that Client has received no such guarantees from good-enough LTD or from any of its introducing or referring agents or other entities with whom Client is conducting his/her good-enough LTD account and has not entered into this Agreement in consideration of or in reliance upon any such guarantees or similar representations. If Client has received any such guarantees or inducements, Client is advised to report such activity to good-enough LTD as promptly as possible.</p>

		</li>

		<li>
			<p><b>DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION.</b>Client represents and warrants to good-enough LTD that the financial information disclosed to good-enough LTD in this document is an accurate representation of Client’s current financial condition and that Client has very carefully considered the portion of the Client’s assets which the Client considers to be risk capital available for investment in Contracts. Client recognizes that risk capital is the amount of money Client is willing to put at risk and if lost would not, in any way, change Client’s lifestyle. Client agrees to inform good-enough LTD immediately if Client’s financial condition changes in such a way as to reduce Client’s net worth, liquid assets and/or risk capital.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
